Last year, I tried to summarize 2011 in a ["By The Numbers"][numbers]
article. I thought I would do the same for 2012, but when I typed up
the list it was underwhelming. An entire year is a lot more complex 
than the books I read or video games I played.

Instead of giving you numbers, I want to tell the story of the whole
year, month-by-month. Brace yourself, it's going to be a long post.

Neither of us can remember where we were for last New Year's Eve; we
might have had people over to our apartment? Later in **January**, I
traveled to Virginia to visit CARFAX headquarters, and returned to
Missouri just in time for our Employee Appreciation Party (also
nicknamed "CARFAX Prom").

In **February** one of my last freelance projects, [Skip Tunes][], was
released on the Mac App Store and was well-received. Laura left her
job at the non-profit Marine Parents, and we both travelled to
California for the first time, for my on-site interview at Apple.

By **March** we were already making plans to move to California; we
started packing things up around the apartment and tried to
coordinate with all the vendors that were going to make our move
possible. On the 30th, my co-workers had a [going-away dinner][away] for me at
Flat Branch, and the 31st was my last day at CARFAX. That night, we had 
all our Columbia friends over to our apartment one last time.

**April** may have been the busiest month: the month we moved. For the
first week, we visited our families in Cape Girardeau. Then we went back to
Columbia to do last-minute packing on the 9th, had everything moved
out on the 10th, flew to California on the 11th, went apartment
hunting on the 12th, visited San Francisco that weekend, and my first
day at Apple was that Monday. Let me tell you, that was a whirlwind
week! Before the month was done, we had already been hiking at Big
Basin and been to the beach at Santa Cruz. On the 30th, I turned 25 years old.
Laura surprised me with a birthday slideshow my family and 
friends had made for me; [you guys are the best][thebest].

In **May** we moved into our new apartment; it didn't take long before
we got our first IKEA furniture ([a couch][]). The car was packed
completely full; Laura even had to hold boxes in her lap to get 
everything to fit. Laura started her job at Henri Bendel. On the 20th 
there was a [solar eclipse][]. From the [25th][] to [28th][] we were back in 
Missouri for our friends' wedding, and to see our families.

It seems like **June** was dominated by WWDC. A big group of people we
knew from Missouri were in town, so [we made a lot of trips][trips] up to San
Francisco to see them. We added another piece of IKEA furniture (a
daybed, for guests). Kyle and Stephen came along with us to see the
Golden Gate Bridge and Sausalito, we visited our friend Tom at
Facebook headquarters, and bumped into Mark Zuckerberg while we were
there.

We spent the 4th of **July** up in San Francisco, where it was so cold
Laura had to buy a scarf: I've never been shivering on the Fourth
before. Later in the month, Laura's whole family came to visit for a
week, so we took them to Ghirardelli Square and some other SF sights. 
The day after they left, my brother paid me a surprise visit, and 
stayed until the end of the month. We introduced Jordan to what's 
probably our favorite restaurant in the universe, [The Tonga Room][].

In **August** Laura left Henri Bendel to start her new job as a
manager at Snap Fitness. She had to go to Minnesota for training, so 
she spent her 24th birthday [on the road][].

In early **September**, we went up to San Francisco to see *[Samsara][]*,
and got to hear a short introduction from the filmmakers themselves.
Laura and I ran (well, "ran") in the Color Me Rad 5K together, and
Laura ran in the [Title Nine 9K][9k]. On the 20th, my parents came to visit,
so we went up to San Francisco to see the Painted Ladies and drink at
the [Monk's Kettle][kettle]. Laura went to Las Vegas for a Snap conference, and
actually won money at the casino!

Our first wedding anniversary was **October** 1st. We spent the
weekend in wine country, and managed to not visit any wineries but did
sneak into [a few breweries][brew] (we still need to go back and actually have
wine). In the middle of the month, Laura's friend Nicole came to visit
us. We attempted to go to Fleet Week up in San Francisco, but couldn't
handle the crowds, so we hung out with friends instead. On the 20th we
went camping in [Yosemite][]; it was Laura's first camping trip, and it
was even in bear country. We came back to civilization and hosted a 
Halloween party where we tried to dress up as Nathan and Chloe from 
Uncharted (I think we did [a pretty good job][uncharted]).

Laura went back to Missouri for the first part of **November**, both
for her sister's birthday and a friend's wedding. We upgraded from a
double to a queen mattress and bed (IKEA loves us). We weren't
able to go back to Missouri for Thanksgiving, but our friend Scott
introduced us to his circle of family friends and we spent the
holiday with them; they were so kind to us and made us feel
welcome. I know I have a lot to be thankful for.

**December** was another busy month: on the 1st we went to a Mad Men
theme party, where I realized Laura can pull off [60s hair][] really well.
We put up and decorated our Christmas tree, and visited a lot of
friends here in California. Then we headed back East to Missouri for
Christmas; we were both glad to spend some more time with our
families. I got to see Cape's new casino for the first time (and threw
away $40 at the craps table). When we got back, I spent a [weekend at Tahoe][Tahoe] 
with some of the guys, and then we had a few people over for New
Year's at our apartment.

And that's it: an entire year in just over 1000 words.
