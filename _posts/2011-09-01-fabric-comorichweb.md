title: Talking About Fabric at Comorichweb 
---

Last week, [Greg Aker][greg] and I gave a talk at [Comorichweb][comorichweb] about [Fabric][],
a Python tool for automating sysadmin tasks over SSH. This is the first time at Comorichweb 
that we had someone record video, (thank you [Robert Boyd][rboyd]) so enjoy the talk below.
